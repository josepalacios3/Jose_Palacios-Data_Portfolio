## 📊 Projects

### 1) 🛠 Data Wrangling and Analysis: NYC Public School Test Scores
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing SAT performance data from New York City public schools. The goal is to provide valuable insights into school performance, based on key metrics from the SAT, across different boroughs. The project involves the following key steps:

🧹 Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values in the dataset and ensuring the data is well-prepared for analysis.
🔄 Data Wrangling: Transforming and organizing the data for meaningful comparisons, including calculating combined SAT scores.
📈 Analysis: Identifying the top-performing schools in math, evaluating overall SAT performance (math, reading, and writing), and investigating borough-level performance variability.
🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, data wrangling with pandas, aggregation techniques, statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation), and generating insights from complex datasets.
